This is a Tetris game
for Gameboy Advance

Made by 
Sebastien Molines
a.k.a.
Clafou

For the four kilobytes
coding competition
organized by
GBAEmu.com




I hope you will
enjoy it! 




-How to play-


Press the
A and B buttons to
make the pieces spin.


Use the arrows to control
the pieces, and the down
arrow to accelerate
their fall.


You'll get further if
you blow up several lines
at once!
...

That's because the speed
gets increased after ten
blow-ups, no matter how
many lines have been
blown up in total.

made this game without

I took advantage of some
of the Gameboy Advance's
great built-in features,
rotational sprites and
alpha-blending.


I coded everything in
ARM Thumb assembly language
in order to keep the
file size small.


Unfortunately, I haven't
seen this run on the
real hardware!

If you can and find
that anything is wrong
please let me know.



Enjoy
